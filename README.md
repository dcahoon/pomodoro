# pomodoro
A pomodoro timer application

This application allows the user to practice the pomodoro technique. The user alternates between periods of focus and rest.

The app defaults to 25 minute focus sessions and 5 minute breaks. The user can change the lengths of each.

When the time limit is reached the app plays a sound and moves to the opposite session type (focus/break).

This app uses React.js and is styled with Bootstrap.
